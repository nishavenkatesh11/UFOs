# UFOs

## Overview

The purpose of this project is to build on a webpage that uses a dynamic table by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, table filters for the city, state, country, and shape are added.

## Results

To use this webapp and query UFO sighting, a visitor must:

* Select a parameter to filter on

* Clear input boxes to reset the filters

## Summary

This project was a success as it expanded the filter parameters and enables event listening.

### Drawbacks
* Currently, there is no easy way to clear the filter parameters inputted. The visitor must go and delete the input manually
* All inputs are case-sensitive

### Recommendations
* Develop an easy way to clear input parameters
* Make the inputs case agnostic (so that it doesn't matter whether the text is in upper or lower case)
* Implement a way to download filtered results for visitors to have on record and further analyse
